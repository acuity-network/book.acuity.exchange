# Introduction

The purpose of the Acuity DEX is to overcome some of the major issues holding back the blockchain ecosystem.

## Debasement

Cryptocurrencies are typically traded on centralized exchanges. This is especially true when trading between chains as non-custodial cross-chain exchanges are less mature than intra-chain or centralized exchanges.

Because centralized exchanges can debase any currency that is trading on their platform, they can collaborate and decide which currencies are going to succeed. They can then use this information to make even more profit.

## Loss of funds

It's a common occurrence for cryptocurrency holders to deposit their funds to a centralized exchange and be unable to withdraw them again.

Because Acuity DEX is non-custodial, this is not an issue.

## Censorship

Increased regulations are making it harder and harder to use centralized exchanges to trade. Because Acuity DEX is fully autonomous traders can have total confidence that they can participate.
