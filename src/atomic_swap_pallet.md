# Atomic Swap Pallet

Substrate chains without smart contract functionality will need to add this pallet to their runtime via the on-chain governance mechanism before the base coin can be traded on Acuity.

Currently, tokens managed by the [Assets Pallet](https://marketplace.substrate.io/pallets/pallet-assets/) are not supported.
