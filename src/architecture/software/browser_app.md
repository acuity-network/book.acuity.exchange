## Wallets

Transactions are issued via third-party wallets such as MetaMask (EVM chains) and [Polkadot{.js}](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) (Substrate chains such as Acuity DEX).

## Status

Status: Needs to be rebuilt from [previous app](https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-dex-app) (written in Vue 3 & TypeScript).
