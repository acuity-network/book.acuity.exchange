# DEX Blockchain Indexer

Both the dapp and the trader bot need to be able to query and subscribe to events from the following on the DEX blockchain:

* Connected Accounts
* Trusted Accounts
* Order Book
* Atomic Swap

This component uses [Hybrid Indexer](https://github.com/hybrid-explorer/hybrid-indexer) to enable indexing of and subscribing to events on the Acuity blockchain.
