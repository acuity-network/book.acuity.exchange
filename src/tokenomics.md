Before the Regenesis as ACU, MIX was funded by a 2000-day [linear vesting](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-vesting-schedules) smart contract [[source](https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-revenue/blob/c8f1e996ceaa9ae879de610510f6d44a253d373b/link_revenue.sol)] starting on 27th April 2017. The original documentation shows the [issuance schedule](https://docs.mix-blockchain.org/en/latest/issuance.html).

At the 29th January 2024 [hardspoon](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#hard-spoon) the total issuance of ACU was 85.2m, 4m being held by founder Jonathan Brown from the linear vesting. He will continue to use these funds to promote development and adoption of ACU.

ACU currently follows the [DOT inflation model](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-inflation) with a maximum annual inflation rate of 10%.

Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, ACU has an anti-debasement strategy. For example, it has been [estimated](https://twitter.com/DominikWeil/status/1590549264337633282) that centralized exchanges had expanded the tradable supply of Bitcoin by 100 million BTC during the last bull run. This has a long term downward pressure on the trading price and is likely one of the major reasons for the crypto bull/bear cycle.

Once the centralized exchanges go bust at the bottom of the market the tradable supply is reduced dramatically, enabling the price to slowly start to increase and the cycle repeats itself.

The Acuity community will use non-violent methods to ensure that ACU is not traded on exchanges that can debase. This is one of the primary reasons why the Acuity DEX is being built.

## How to buy

In order to hold ACU, you need to create install the [Polkadot browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) and create an account on the [Acuity blockchain](https://chains.acuity.social/).

Until the DEX is up and running and has sufficient liquidity ACU can be purchased directly from Acuity founder Jonathan Brown. This helps fund development. Email [purchase@acuity.social](mailto:purchase@acuity.social).
