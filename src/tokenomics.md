Before the [Regenesis](https://acuity.social/regenesis) as ACU, MIX was funded by a 2000-day [linear vesting](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-vesting-schedules) smart contract [[source](https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-revenue/blob/c8f1e996ceaa9ae879de610510f6d44a253d373b/link_revenue.sol)] starting on 27th April 2017. The original documentation shows the [issuance schedule](https://docs.mix-blockchain.org/en/latest/issuance.html).

At the time of the January 2024 hardspoon the total issuance of ACU was 85.2m, 4m being held by founder Jonathan Brown from the linear vesting. He will continue to use these funds to promote adoption of ACU.

ACU currently follows the DOT [inflation model](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-inflation) of 10%.
